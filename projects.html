         <p><strong>Description of the app and purpose:</strong></p>
         <p> The purpose of the app is supposed to be an easier way to create a poster template and to draw directly on a photo.</p> 
         <p><strong>Description of development and skills learned:</strong></p>
         <p> The development of this program was with MIT App Inventor, which is where you create an app with pre-made coding blocks. I skill from making this app was that it was easy to come up with an idea to make for the project but creating the app with limits is a way to be creative with the functions that you have to get the job done.</p>

         <p><strong>Description of story and purpose:</strong></p>
         <p> The story is a story that my partner and I made up about a land called ElderWood. The purpose of the story is to simulate a place and some actions to let players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment.</p> 
         <p><strong>Description of development and skills learned:</strong></p>
         <p> The development of this story was in Repl.it, which used Python 3.6.1. I learned that Python 3.6.1 had slightly changed from the later verions of Python, so my partner and I had to figure a way around our outdated coding and find a way to update it to the correct coding for the new version.</p>
