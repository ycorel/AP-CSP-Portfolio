         <p><strong>Description of project and purpose:</strong></p>
         <p> The data MIT and Microsoft use are collecting data from the vehicle and determined the amount of human blind spots to transform and overcome all blind spots in a vehicle, which you can read the research from ‘Overcoming Blind Spots in the Real World…’ from Microsoft. One data storage concern is that the system takes in a lot of data, determines the majority of answers, and then ignores the rest of the data, to save data space, but the other data is very important if it can save a life. As stated in MIT News, “If the system performed correct actions nine times out of 10 in the ambulance situation, for instance, a simple majority vote would label that situation as safe. ‘But because unacceptable actions are far rarer than acceptable actions, the system will eventually learn to predict all situations as safe, which can be extremely dangerous,’ Ramakrishnan says.”.</p>
